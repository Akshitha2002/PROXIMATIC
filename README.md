# PROXIMATIC
PROXIMATIC is a revolutionary system that offers human presence detection and automation functionalities. It has the ability to detect the presence of humans and trigger various system operations such as boosting the performance of systems, controlling tube lights, fans, and more.

When a human is detected, PROXIMATIC intelligently enhances the functionality of the systems to meet the user's requirements. For example, it can increase the speed of operations or adjust the settings to optimize the user experience.

On the other hand, when the human presence disappears, PROXIMATIC understands that the systems are no longer required and automatically initiates a shutdown process. This ensures that energy is not wasted unnecessarily, promoting energy efficiency and reducing costs.

To further enhance the capabilities of PROXIMATIC, we can introduce 5G automation. With the integration of 5G technology, PROXIMATIC can communicate and exchange data faster and more efficiently. This enables real-time monitoring, faster response times, and seamless integration with other smart devices and systems.

By combining the power of PROXIMATIC with 5G automation, we can unlock new levels of speed, efficiency, and control. The advanced capabilities offered by this integration have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with automated systems, creating a more intelligent and responsive environment.

PROXIMATIC with 5G automation opens up new possibilities for industries, businesses, and personal use, enabling us to harness the full potential of automation and improve our overall productivity and convenience.
